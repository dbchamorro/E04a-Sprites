# E04a-Sprites
This is an exercise to start playing with sprites and physics in Godot.

This is my attempt at the assignment. I added 6 blocks for the 4 sprites to bounce off of. I put a unique number to each of the sprites bounce and friction as well as with the 'blocks' to get a chaotic scene of bounciness.
